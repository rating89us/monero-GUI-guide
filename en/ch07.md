# Transactions History
![transactions](media/black_transactions-history.png)

The `Transactions` tab let you walk through the transactions sent and received on the currently selected account of your Monero wallet.

(1) **Search:** Quickly filter out transactions from the list searching by transaction ID, destination address, address book label (destination address label), receiving address, receiving address label, description, amount or blockheight (number of the block in which the transaction was included by a miner).  
(2) **Sort & Filter:** Here you can filter out transactions between specific dates, or sort them by blockheight, date or amount.  
(3) **Transaction list:** This area displays the sent and received transactions of the currently selected account.  
For incoming transactions you will see: `Transaction type` (Received), `Amount`, `In` (your wallet's address which received this transaction and its label), and `Date`. Because of Monero's privacy-preserving technology, it's not possible to know the sender's address. Therefore, in order to know from who you are receiving each transaction, you should always remember to create and give a new subaddress for every person you will receive Monero from.  
For outgoing transactions you will see: `Transaction type` (Sent), `Amount`, `To` (the destination address or its Address Book name), and `Date`.  
Transactions with 0 confirmations (included in the mempool but not in a block yet) are displayed as `Pending`.  
Transactions that couldn't be sent are displayed as `Failed`.  
By clicking on a transaction, you will see the following additional information: `Fee` (outgoing transactions), `Confirmations`, `Description` (optional), `Transaction ID`, `Transaction key`, and `Blockheight`. The transaction ID, the transaction key and the destination address can be used to prove that a payment was done in case of a dispute. The transaction keys and the descriptions (notes) are stored in the cache of your local wallet, therefore they cannot be recovered from the blockchain.  
(4) **Details:** Clicking here will show you the following transaction details, when available: `Transaction ID`, `Date`, `Amount`, `Address`, `Payment ID`, `Integrated address`, `Transaction key`, `Description (note)`, `Destinations` and `Rings`.  
(5) **Prove payment (P):** Clicking here will generate a payment proof, which you can use, in case of a dispute, to prove that you made a payment. More details on proving payments can be found [here](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html)  
(6) **Set description:** Click on this icon to set a new description or edit an existing one.
